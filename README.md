# Micro Projects
this is **MICRO LAND**, where all characteristically micro, small, tiny projects go.

If a project is typically made only to learn some concept, it's likely a micro project.
If a project can fit in 100 lines of code or less, it's a micro project.

If I made a repo for every micro project, it would probably (not) overwhelm gh servers, 
so this is where they go to die/live a happy retirement.
